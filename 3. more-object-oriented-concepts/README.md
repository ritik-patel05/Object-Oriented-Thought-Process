# more-object-oriented-concepts

- Constructors
  - When they are called? -> When a new object is created.
  - Job:
    - To initialize the memory
    - To call the constructor of its superclass.
  - If no constructor explicitly mentioned, default constructor always exists
  - Atleast one constructor always exists
- Multiple objects can be instantiated from a single class
- Each of these objects has a **unique** *identity* and *state*
- Methods: Represent *behaviours* of an object
- Attributes: Represent *state* of an object
- Operator Overloading
  - Enables us to change the meaning of an operator
  - Ex: + sign for strings can be overloaded to perform string concatenation
  - Ex: + for matrix, can perform matrix addition.
  - Be careful with it, it can be confusing. So document the logic so that people maintaining the code understand what is happening.
- Multiple Inheritance
  - To inherit from more than one class
  - It is a powerful technique, and some problems are difficult to solve w/o it.
  - In C++ we can, but not in Java, .NET, Swift(Bec. its complexity far outweighed its advantages)
- Object Operations:
  - Not easy to compare and copy an object.
  - Deep Copy: Must follow all references and create a new copy of all of them.
  - Class should have its own comparision method to compare itself.
