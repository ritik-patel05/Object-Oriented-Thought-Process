**Encapsulation** — Encapsulating the data and behavior into a single object is of primary importance in OO development. A single object contains both its data and behaviors and can hide what it wants from other objects.
The basic question is what in a class should be exposed and what should not be exposed. This encapsulation pertains equally to data and behavior.

Encapsualtion is fundamental to the concept of OO.

“the process of packaging your program, dividing each of its classes into two distinct parts: the public interface and the private implementation.” This is the message that has been presented over and over in this book.”

In essence, a class hides everything that is not necessary for other classes to know about.

**Inheritance(is-a)** — A class can inherit from another class and take advantage of the attributes and methods defined by the superclass.
Ex: Cat *is-a* Mammal, Dog *is-a* Mammal

**Polymorphism** — Polymorphism means that similar objects can respond to the same message in different ways. For example, you might have a system with many shapes. However, a circle, a square, and a star are each drawn differently. Using polymorphism, you can send each of these shapes the same message (for example, Draw), and each shape is responsible for drawing itself.

**Composition(has-a)** — Composition means that an object is built from other objects.
Ex: a computer *has-a* video card, *has-a* keyboard, and *has-a* disk drive
